 Introduction

HIV is a public health concern worldwide and efforts are underway to eliminate the virus by 2030. However, knowing one's HIV status is crucial as it provides an entry point into HIV care, treatment and lifelong support. This is especially important in regions with the highest burden of HIV such as the Sub-Saharan Africa. There is documented evidence that HIV incidence is high among women especially those in the older age groups. Therefore, understanding HIV status among women is key in preventing the acquisition of the disease or linking to HIV care and treatment.

The objective of the assessment is to evaluate the uptake of HIV testing by social demographic factors among women aged between 15 and 49 years in **South Africa**. The data source for this analysis is the *2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Surveys(DHS)*. More info about the survey can be found [here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/).
